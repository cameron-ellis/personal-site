            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">I am a second year undergraduate student at the Univeristy of Missouri - Columbia pursuing a double major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My passions lie in both computer hardware as well as development, and I hope to one day achieve a Masters specializing in either CPU and GPU architecture, or Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.</p>

              <h3>Software & Web Development</h3>
              <p>During my two years thus far at Mizzou, I have had exstensive work and experience with algorithms and data structures in the C language, as well as experience with database management and web application deployment using MySQL and PHP. In my personal studies, I have also taken on web development by helping create and maintain the website for We Care STL, a nonprofit organization based in St. Louis Missouri that specializes in sending care packages to local clinics that give much needed supplies to the underinsured and impoverished in the area. There I make use of React and Netlify to create and deploy the web page utilising a modern and easy to navigate UI for a beautiful and seamless user experience.</p>

              <h3>Electrical & Computer Hardware</h3>
              <p>The bulk of my studies at Mizzou have focused around learning and working with computer hardware. As of now I have gained hands on experience and theoretical understanding in circuits and logic systems. I have also been able to put this learning to use by being a part of the Mizzou Robotics Club, where I have worked on multiple embedded systems projects ranging from a contactless thermometer device that we developed using the Arduino Uno micontroller, to a "NavBot" which we have been developing to give new students a robot that can guide them through the engineering building and show them to their classes.</p>
